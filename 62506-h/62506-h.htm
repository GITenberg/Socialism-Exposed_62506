PAULS CHURCHYARD.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Owen</span> professes to be seeking
the happiness of his species: he imagines he has discovered the
specific, which, if believed and applied, will produce it; and he
is using all the means in his power to convince the world that
such is the fact, and to induce the men of it to receive, and
follow his prescriptions.</p>
<p>We must confess that we are not a little startled at the means
by which he proposes to accomplish this desirable object.&nbsp;
And here we quote his own language: &ldquo;The religions founded
under the name of Jewish, Budh, Jehovah, God or Christ, Mohammed,
or any other, are all composed of human laws in opposition to
nature&rsquo;s eternal laws.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Book of the New Moral
World, p. 68.)&nbsp; From which it appears that all other systems
have been wrong, founded on error, and productive of nothing but
misery and crime: and before his can be established they must be
renounced, and overturned, and abolished.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Owen
professes to have found out something better than what I and the
world are in possession of; but I do not wish to be like the dog
in the fable, which, when he had a piece of meat, dropped it,
because, from seeing its shadow in the water, he fancied there
was another and a larger within his reach, and so lost them
both.&nbsp; Before I give up what I know and feel to be valuable,
the source of comfort and the source of happiness, let me not
only be convinced that it is a superior good which is held out
before me, but let me have the possession of it.</p>
<p>Then let me ask, What evidence does Mr. Owen furnish, that the
system and principles of the New Moral World <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>are so much
superior to those of the Christian system?&nbsp; Let us contrast
the two a little, and see how far we shall be acting wisely in
rejecting all that we have been accustomed to believe and
reverence as Divine in favour of these new principles.</p>
<p>And first, as to the evidence of their authority.&nbsp; The
writers of the Bible, while they come to us claiming our
attention, and demanding our regard, tell us that they are only
messengers sent from God; they come in his name and speak what he
has put into their minds and their mouths; and, as a proof of
their being what they profess, as credentials, they work miracles
which none but a Divine power could work; they deliver prophecies
and predictions of events, many of which have since come to pass,
and others are in course of accomplishment; and they announce
truths, doctrines, and principles which, for their originality
and yet beautiful simplicity, for their importance, and at the
same time their universal adaptation to the wants and the
circumstances of the whole human race, and for their purity and
invariable tendency to good, speak for themselves, and declare
that they are Divine.&nbsp; Yet a book resting on such authority,
and supported by such testimonials, is to be rejected, and thrown
aside, and its principles are pronounced to be evil and unsound,
on the authority of&mdash;whom think you?&nbsp; Mr. Robert
Owen!!</p>
<p>Is it not a fearful responsibility which such an individual
assumes, to tell me that I am not to believe a testimony which is
supported by miracles, is confirmed by prophecies, and, above
all, is borne out by its own native dignity, and intrinsic beauty
and worth?&nbsp; Surely such a person ought to be furnished, and
he ought to present to those whom he wishes to believe him,
evidence of his authority, and proofs of his claims to the high
distinction to which he aspires, to be the founder of a New Moral
World.&nbsp; Then, where are Mr. Owen&rsquo;s claims?&nbsp; And
what are his proofs?&nbsp; Would you believe it?&nbsp; He adduces
nothing but his simple testimony! his own unsupported
word!!&nbsp; Here is a man wiser than Solomon, and more profound
than Moses!&nbsp; He is even superior to Jesus Christ, the Son of
God!!!&nbsp; And this you and I are called upon to believe simply
because he himself says so!!!</p>
<p>Well, but after all he may have pretensions to our notice, and
if we do not receive his revelation, we may be shutting <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>our eyes to our
own happiness, and the means of our welfare.&nbsp; Then let me
ask, Upon what are those pretensions founded?&nbsp; Truths, which
are propounded, sometimes gain attention from the character and
well-known ability of the persons that propound them.&nbsp; Thus
great names often obtain currency for sentiments which otherwise
would not receive a moment&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; Then,
perhaps, Mr. Owen is to eclipse and throw into the shade all
other minds that have preceded him.&nbsp; That is (to say nothing
of Isaiah, and Paul, and Daniel, and many other scriptural
worthies) Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton, and John Locke, and
Francis Bacon, and John Milton, and a host more of such great and
mighty minds, are nothing before Mr. Owen!!!&nbsp; Does he
himself pretend this?&nbsp; Let us give him credit for so much
modesty as not to put forth such pretensions.</p>
<p>Then if he be not superior to those stars in intellect, to
those giants in mind which have preceded him, and all of whom
expressed their admiration of the Bible, and bore their strongest
testimony to its Divinity and authority, perhaps his
opportunities of coming at the truth, in reference to the
principles upon which the New Moral World is to be founded, have
given him the advantage, and enabled him, though inferior, to
succeed, while others, very greatly his superiors, have
failed.&nbsp; Then what advantages does he profess to have
enjoyed?&nbsp; He himself shall tell us: &ldquo;It is a system
the result of much reading, observation, and reflection, combined
with extensive practical experience, and confidential
communication with official public characters in various
countries, and with leading minds among all classes; a system
founded on the eternal laws of nature, and derived from facts and
experience only.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Preface to the Book of the New
Moral World, p. x.)&nbsp; And thus, without even pretending that
he has spent his time, or devoted his energies, to an examination
and careful investigation of the book which professes to be
Divine, and of the truths and doctrines which it contains, he
calls upon us to reject and renounce it, while these great minds
have spent, not only hours but years upon its study, and as the
result of their investigations have expressed their highest
admiration of its contents, and have employed their talents and
influence to recommend it to others.&nbsp; And here I might
adduce testimonies to its excellence were it necessary; but that
is a work of supererogation.&nbsp; Then I appeal to every <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>wise, to every
reflecting mind.&nbsp; Can those persons be acting the part of
rational beings, who in a matter of such infinite moment as a
revelation from Heaven, with its momentous contents, refuse to
receive it, although supported by the strongest arguments, and
confirmed by the most invincible testimonies,&mdash;testimonies
from miracles, from prophecies, from history, from men of the
greatest learning, and the most powerful minds, and even from
enemies; and that, too, as the result of the closest
investigation, and also personal experience, of its truths,
merely because Mr. Owen says that it ought not to be received,
and that it must be rejected before his system can be
established?&nbsp; Matters have indeed come to a fearful pass,
when Mr. Owen ventures, not only to set himself against, but
wants to claim superiority over the wisest and the greatest men
of all ages, and of all countries; over prophets, and apostles,
and evangelists; over Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and even over
God himself!</p>
<p>But, suppose we throw away that book which we have been
accustomed to hold sacred,&mdash;suppose we consent to regard Mr.
Owen as the wisest of men, and to receive his principles as the
standard of unerring truth, and to adopt them; surely we may not
only expect, but we shall certainly find, emanating from him
nothing but the truth; and we may venture implicitly to follow
him, when he commands us so to do.&nbsp; But to show how far he
is a safe guide, I need do no more than refer to his own
statements at different times.&nbsp; Thus, in 1823, Mr. Owen
developed the principles of his system in a series of letters,
published in the &ldquo;Glasgow Chronicle,&rdquo; contained in
twelve propositions, preceded by one general proposition, as the
foundation of the whole.&nbsp; But, since then, his twelve
propositions have dwindled down to five fundamental facts; only,
to make up for the loss in fundamental principles, we have now
twenty supplemental laws.&nbsp; But, if in 1823, Mr. Owen had
discovered and revealed the laws of nature, and those laws he
expressly declares to be immutable, how comes it to pass that in
1838 they have so greatly altered, not only in their number and
form, but also in their very nature, as given in the &ldquo;New
Moral World?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If alterations so many, and so fundamental, can take place in
the immutable laws of nature; if in 1823, Mr. Owen can require
credence and implicit confidence in his principles <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>as infallible
truth; and then again in 1838, can demand credence and implicit
confidence in a new and quite different set of principles, and
declare that they also are infallible truth, may he not in 1848,
if Providence should spare his life so long, have discovered some
new laws, and found out some fresh principles?&nbsp; If it should
be replied, No, he has now got the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth; we answer, So he said in 1823.&nbsp; And
yet he has changed his principles, call it improved them, if you
like, but they are different, and they may yet change
again.&nbsp; How, then, can we be certain that we have now got
the truth?&nbsp; If not, would it be wise to throw away the
volume of inspiration, the word of unerring truth, before we are
certain that we have something better to supply its place?</p>
<p>But if we admit, for the sake of argument, that the principles
of the &ldquo;New Moral World,&rdquo; are now fixed, and will no
more be changed; let us see how far they recommend themselves
from their own intrinsic nature, and internal excellence.</p>
<p>And to begin with his first fact, which tells us that
&ldquo;man is a compound being,&rdquo; and his first law, which
declares that &ldquo;human nature, in the aggregate, is a
compound, consisting of animal propensities, intellectual
faculties, and moral qualities.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pray how does Mr.
Owen come to know any thing about man or human nature?&nbsp; And
from what source did he obtain those views of his constitution
which he promulgates to the world as the unerring principles of
truth: and especially, as he tells us that man is &ldquo;made by
a power unknown to himself, and without his knowledge or
consent.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, upon Mr. Owen&rsquo;s own principle,
man knows nothing of himself, then how does Mr. Owen know any
thing about him?</p>
<p>If he does not know, and has not perfect knowledge on the
subject on which he takes upon himself to speak with the most
unbounded confidence, he certainly is very unfit for the office
to which he aspires, of teaching others; but if he has knowledge,
where did he obtain it? for, according to his own principles, all
the thoughts of the human mind are not the voluntary acts of the
mind, but entirely the result of circumstances, and are
communicated to him; and consequently man knows nothing but what
he is taught.&nbsp; Mr. Owen&rsquo;s knowledge, then must have
been imparted to him.&nbsp; <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Now then, who communicated it to
him?&nbsp; He must have received it from some man, or he must
have derived it from inspiration.&nbsp; If he received it from a
human teacher, it is very disingenuous in him to take to himself
the merit of discoveries which belong to another; but, if he
obtained his knowledge by inspiration, it certainly would only be
candid for him to let us know when he was inspired, and also let
us judge of the evidence of his inspiration; for unless he does
that, as this is the ground on which the Christian Scriptures
rest, and they do give us many strong and unequivocal proofs of
their Divine origin, I and many more prefer taking what we know
to be from God, to the unsupported testimony or revelation of
Robert Owen.&nbsp; But, Mr. Owen may say that he has not received
what he undertakes to teach, either from man or God: then he
himself overturns his own system; for he expressly says that man
can know nothing but what he is taught.&nbsp; From the very first
position, therefore, which Mr. Owen takes, it will be seen how
ill qualified he is to be the great teacher of the world.</p>
<p>Nor is the next attempt which he makes at imparting knowledge
much better, if any, than the first.&nbsp; It is that man, who
did not make himself, but was made by a power unknown to himself,
is the creature of circumstances, over which he has no control,
and in fact, is nothing but what he is made: or in other words,
that he is a mere machine.&nbsp; Some, perhaps, may be a little
startled at the deduction which I profess to draw from Mr.
Owen&rsquo;s principles, and think that he is not quite so bad as
that: but I can tell them it is not a deduction of mine; it is
one of the fundamental principles, nay, the corner-stone of Mr.
Owen&rsquo;s system, the admission and belief of which is
essential to his success.&nbsp; Nay, in one of his works,
&ldquo;Essays on the formation of the human character,&rdquo; he
expressly says that men are &ldquo;living machines,&rdquo; p.
28.&nbsp; Whether even the followers of Mr. Owen may be flattered
at being accounted only machines, and may be willing that he
should mould and use them as he pleases, in working out his
results, I know not: but I do think that men in general will not
thank him for the compliment, nor be inclined to become his
tools.&nbsp; It is too great a fall from the dignity of high,
intelligent, rational, and accountable beings, to be treated as
&ldquo;living machines;&rdquo; especially when every man,
whatever <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>may
be his circumstances, has only need to appeal to his own
consciousness for the evidences of the fact, that he is not a
machine.</p>
<p>But Mr. Owen tells us, &ldquo;Men are nothing but what they
are made, and they are made to be what they are by their
organization, and the external circumstances which act upon and
influence it,&rdquo; namely, that organization.&nbsp; &ldquo;None
are, or can be bad by nature; their education,&rdquo; which makes
them bad, &ldquo;is always the business or work of society, and
not of the individual.&nbsp; The individual is thus, evidently, a
material of nature, finished and fashioned by the society in
which it lives, according to the ignorance, or the intelligence,
or the knowledge of human nature, which that society has been
made to possess, and by the influence of other external
circumstances, with which the individual may be
surrounded.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Book of the New Moral World, p.
54.)&nbsp; But, if this statement be true, that the nature of man
is good, and he would never be bad if he were not taught to be
so, we now shall want all Mr. Owen&rsquo;s wisdom to explain to
us how, upon his system, evil and sin first came into the
world.&nbsp; That they are in the world, he cannot but admit;
indeed, he tells us that it is the object of his system to drive
them out of it.&nbsp; Well, then, will he have the goodness to
tell us how, upon his system, they first came into the
world?&nbsp; Man could not do wrong without his being taught to
do wrong? then who first taught him?&nbsp; And whence did he
receive it?&nbsp; According to Mr. Owen&rsquo;s theory, man could
not receive it from himself; whence, then, did he get it?&nbsp;
It must have been from some sinful being who was in the world
before sin itself, which is a palpable contradiction!&nbsp; But,
if the natural effect of Mr. Owen&rsquo;s system be to lead to
this absurdity, it requires nothing more to show that it is not,
and cannot be, according to truth.</p>
<p>But, if Mr. Owen&rsquo;s principles be true, and the nature of
man is inherently good, according to his own showing, his system
is altogether unnecessary.&nbsp; For, if man would not be bad
were he not taught to be so, surely the simplest and the easiest
plan would be to take the human race in infancy, before they have
been contaminated, or rather, &ldquo;made to receive an
unfavourable character,&rdquo; and let the germs of goodness
which they have within them develope themselves, and come to
perfection.&nbsp; Should we, then, have a paradise without
sin?&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Mr. Owen knows that there is not a single <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>spot on this
earth which has not been contaminated with sin; and instead of
human nature being in a state the nearest approaching to
perfection where there has been least contact with the truths and
doctrines of the Bible, which he regards as the source of all the
errors and all the evils which there are in the world, (see p.
60, Book of the New Moral World,) it is the testimony of
universal history and fact, that there it is the most
depraved.</p>
<p>It is, however, not necessary to go to what may be termed the
children of nature, to the untutored sons of the forest, to
prove, not only the existence of sin, but also of a sinful
disposition, of a natural tendency to evil even in the infant
breast; it might be furnished to almost any extent from Mr.
Owen&rsquo;s own establishments, and from the lips of his own
agents.&nbsp; It is possible that Mr. Owen himself, from his
attachment to a favourite theory, and his desire to support it at
all hazards, as well as from having his mind absorbed in the
grand object which he has before him, may not see what is so
plain to others; or, it may be that what appears black to them is
white to him; but let his dancing masters, and the nurses of his
infant children, be brought into an open court and fully
examined, and they will testify to the satisfaction of every
impartial jury, although composed even of Robert Owen&rsquo;s
followers, that some, at least, of these urchins, at an age when
they could not have been taught these things, unless their
mother&rsquo;s milk imparted them, display passions and
dispositions which indicate anything rather than an entire
absence from evil.&nbsp; We shall require no other witnesses to
prove that the nature of man is not naturally good, but is
inherently depraved.</p>
<p>But, if man from his birth has an evil principle within him,
(I would call it a depraved nature,) then Mr. Owen&rsquo;s
principles, however much they may modify and change the external
character, will not avail in changing the heart.&nbsp; His system
will no more produce the results which he promises, the paradise
of joy which he pictures before his followers, than have the
systems of the old world.&nbsp; And, therefore, he is only
amusing and deluding those that attend to him with pleasing
dreams which can never be realized.&nbsp; If this, however, were
all, it would not much matter; he might be left to pursue his
course undisturbed; but when it is known that the effect of his
system, whatever may be his design, is to take off the mind from
everything <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>but what is connected with his earthly paradise, and so
cause it to neglect, and even despise everything connected with
eternity and everlasting life, and the happiness of the principle
which never dies, it would be, not only a dereliction of
principle, but also a want of love to one&rsquo;s species, not to
lift up the voice against him, and endeavour to warn such persons
of their fatal error, and the destructive consequences which
must, and will inevitably ensue.</p>
<p>But another fundamental principle of Mr. Owen&rsquo;s system,
as expressed in the 2nd and 3rd Fundamental Facts, and 13th Law,
is, &ldquo;Man is compelled by his original constitution, to
receive his feelings and his convictions independently of his
will;&rdquo; and &ldquo;his feelings, or his convictions, or both
of them united, create the motive to action called the will,
which stimulates him to act, and decides his actions;&rdquo; and
&ldquo;each individual is so organized that he must believe
according to the strongest conviction which is made upon his
mind:&rdquo; the plain meaning of which is, that man is not
accountable for his belief, neither ought he to be considered
accountable for his actions; and which, indeed, Mr. Owen does not
leave his readers to deduce from his principles, but which he
himself explicitly states.&nbsp; Thus, he says, &ldquo;Man cannot
be bad by nature, and it must,&rdquo; therefore, &ldquo;be a
gross error to make him responsible for what nature and his
predecessors have compelled him to be.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Book of the
New Moral World, p. 54.)</p>
<p>That man is not accountable, that he can think as he likes,
and act as he pleases, without being amenable, either to God or
man, for his thoughts or his actions, is a doctrine which will
well accord with the wishes of all those who feel the idea of God
and judgment a restraint upon their conduct, and human laws
oftentimes a barrier in the way of indulging their evil
desires.&nbsp; And it is lamentable to think how many, even of
this description of persons, there are to be found in the
world.</p>
<p>But it is a question of the deepest importance, whether or not
this principle be true.&nbsp; Mr. Owen calls it a law and a fact;
and if persons are willing to take what he says for granted,
merely because he says it, and so to stake their character in
this world, and their eternal well-being in another, upon his
unsupported testimony, they may endeavour to satisfy themselves
in believing it, and try to make and keep their consciences as
easy as they can.&nbsp; What a happy <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>thing it would be, if Mr.
Owen&rsquo;s saying that there is no judgment, and that man is
not accountable, could make it be so!&nbsp; But is it so?&nbsp;
We all know that Mr. Owen&rsquo;s saying that there is no guilt
in crime, that man acts only as he is compelled to do, and ought
not, therefore, to be either punished or praised for what he
does, does not release him from the responsibility imposed by
human government and human laws; and it is well both for him and
for us, that it does not; for only break the bonds of law, and
leave each one to act as he likes, and what a pandemonium,
instead of a paradise, we should have!&nbsp; Why even Mr. Owen
himself is under the necessity, in his own paradise, of imposing
laws, and putting very considerable restraint upon the wishes and
the inclinations of those that expected when they entered his
establishment to be perfectly happy in the enjoyment of their own
will.&nbsp; As a proof of this, I beg to give an extract from a
published statement of a visit paid to New Harmony, in America,
by the Duke of Saxe Weimar, in April, 1826.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Sunday morning, the society met in the
large building, and the meeting was opened by music.&nbsp; Mr.
Owen delivered a discourse on the advantages of the
society.&nbsp; In the evening the duke paid visits to the ladies,
and witnessed philosophy, and the love of equality put to the
severest trial with one of them, young and handsome.&nbsp; While
she was singing, and playing very well on the pianoforte, she was
told that milking of cows was her duty.&nbsp; Almost in tears,
she betook herself to this servile employment, deprecating the
new social system, and its so much prized equality.&nbsp; After
the cows were milked, in doing which this pretty girl was trod on
by one, and daubed by another, the duke made one in an aquatic
party with the young ladies and some of the young philosophers,
in a boat, upon the Wabash.&nbsp; The evening was
beautiful.&nbsp; The duke&rsquo;s heroine regaled the party with
her sweet voice.&nbsp; Afterwards, the whole party amused
themselves in dancing cotillions, reels, and waltzes, and with
such animation as to render it, as the duke adds, quite
lively.&nbsp; A new figure had been introduced into the
cotillions, called the New Social System.&nbsp; Several of the
ladies objected to dancing on Sunday.&nbsp; &lsquo;We thought,
however,&rsquo; writes the Duke, &lsquo;that in this sanctuary of
philosophy, such prejudices should be utterly discarded, and our
arguments, as well as <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the inclination of the ladies, gained
the victory.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; (Three years in North America,
by James Stuart, Esq., vol. ii. p. 442.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And not only is Mr. Owen under the necessity of passing laws,
and of making those that belong to his establishment amenable to
those laws, but the whole of his system is founded upon
compulsion, both mental and bodily; for he would take infants
from the care of their mothers, and put them under the care of
his dancing-master, and there train them according to his model,
and mould them according to his ideas; and that, no doubt,
oftentimes very much against the inclination of the children
themselves.&nbsp; The only difference between the present state
of things, and the state which he wishes to introduce is, that he
would put himself in the place of God, and of all human laws; and
not only give laws to all his followers, but also enforce
them.&nbsp; Whether the task would not be more than he could
accomplish you shall judge by and by.</p>
<p>But as Mr. Owen cannot release us from the obligation of human
laws, neither can he from that of the laws of God.&nbsp; Man may
say, &ldquo;Who is the Lord, that I should obey him?&rdquo; but,
even while he is saying it, he feels, whether he will or not, and
is under the necessity of acknowledging to his own mind, that
there is a Being above him whom he does not love, but from whose
eye, and whose power he cannot escape; before whose dread
tribunal he is conscious that he must stand, and be &ldquo;judged
according to the deeds which have been done in the body, whether
they be good, or whether they be evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is one
of those eternal laws which are engraven, not only in the face of
nature, but upon every mind and conscience, which Mr. Owen wishes
to erase, and in the room of which he would write what he calls
&ldquo;the eternal laws of nature:&rdquo; and in the
accomplishment of his task, there are multitudes that would
gladly help him, and contribute all the aid in their power; and,
so eager are they for the accomplishment of his and their wishes,
that they have even agreed to believe it, or rather, agreed to
say that they believe it, and to act upon it, before it has been
proved to be true.</p>
<p>Nor is it possible for them to prove it.&nbsp; They might as
well attempt to prove that the sun does not shine at noonday, and
they would have quite as much hope of success, as attempt to
prove either to themselves or others, that <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>&ldquo;there
is no God,&rdquo; and that there is no hereafter.&nbsp; They may
argue with themselves upon the subject, and attempt to convince
themselves of the truth of what they wish to be true; and
sometimes they may think they have satisfied themselves upon the
point; but the next day, or perhaps the next hour, the sight of a
funeral, the hearing of the death of a fellow creature, or even a
sharp pain in their own bodies, sweeps away in a moment all the
cobwebs which they have been weaving, and leaves them exposed to
the naked truth, unsheltered and unprepared, that there is a
judgment, and that they must stand and be judged.</p>
<p>And this judgment will be, whatever Mr. Owen may say to the
contrary, not only for actions but for thoughts and
opinions.&nbsp; And it is strictly reasonable that it should be
so; for not only is man not compelled to believe, contrary to his
will, but he is not compelled to believe at all.&nbsp; He is a
rational and intelligent creature, and from the very constitution
of his being, he must and can believe, only as he has evidence
upon which his belief is to be founded.&nbsp; For the mind to
believe without evidence, is like the eye seeing without
light.&nbsp; But there may be light, and yet the eye may not see,
for it may shut itself.&nbsp; And there may be evidence which
would carry conviction to the mind if it were brought before it,
and yet the mind may not be convinced, simply because it will not
receive it, for it does not wish to be convinced.&nbsp; But who
does not know that there are none so deaf as those who will not
hear!&nbsp; And, in like manner, we say, &ldquo;There are none so
blind as those who will not see.&rdquo;&nbsp; Men have the law
which they are bound to obey&mdash;the law of God; they have the
means of becoming acquainted with that law; they have the ability
to perform all that this law requires, if they are so disposed;
if, therefore, they break this law, it is not because they are
compelled so to do, but their own voluntary act and deed; and
reason tells them that it is just that they should be punished
for their transgressions.&nbsp; In like manner, the gospel of
Jesus Christ reveals to man a way of escape from the miseries of
the fall, those miseries which Mr. Owen admits to exist, whatever
he may say respecting the source from which they spring; which
way is a provision of mercy, and an act of grace on the part of
the Divine Being.&nbsp; For the accomplishment of it, he gave <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>his own Son
to die in the stead of man; and as the result of his death, he
has offered salvation, and that freely, to every one that
believeth.&nbsp; Now, the evidence, upon which these glorious
truths rest, is such, so full, so clear, and so conclusive, that
he may run that readeth; and man has the means of knowing these
truths: if, therefore, he remain in ignorance respecting them, or
when they are brought before him he does not believe them, it is
entirely a wilful and a voluntary unbelief.&nbsp; For that he
will be condemned, and reason will approve his doom.</p>
<p>In wading through the mass of absurdities and errors contained
in Mr. Owen&rsquo;s principles, as developed in the &ldquo;Book
of the New Moral World,&rdquo; it would have been a very easy
task to have selected a number more which might have been
exposed: but to go through the whole work page by page, would
indeed be labour lost, as to most readers; for I am persuaded
there are very few that understand, or even profess completely to
understand his principles.&nbsp; Neither is it necessary for
their purpose that they should.&nbsp; What they want is a system
which shall let them live and do as they like, without being
exposed to the consequences of their conduct, and this they find
in the system of the New Moral World.&nbsp; But I think I have
knocked down some, if not all the main pillars of the structure:
the rest will fall of themselves.</p>
<p>There is, however, one law of such a character, which, when
understood, will perhaps have a greater influence in preserving
such as have no selfish or wicked ends to answer, from falling
into his pernicious errors, than any long train of argument, and
that is the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Each individual is so
organized that he must like that which is pleasant to him, or
which, in other words, produces agreeable sensations in him; and
dislike that which is unpleasant to him, or which, in other
words, produces in him disagreeable sensations; and he cannot
know previous to experience, what particular sensations new
objects will produce on any of his senses.&rdquo; (Law 12.)</p>
<p>The meaning of this law will be best explained by an extract
from Mr. Owen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Declaration of Mental Independence,
addressed to the Society at New Harmony, July 4, 1826,&rdquo; in
which, in reference to the law of marriage, he says, &ldquo;It
is, in reality, the greatest crime against nature to prevent
organized beings from uniting with those objects, or other
organized beings, with which nature has created in them a desire
to unite.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Thus
has Robert Owen ventured, not only to set himself in opposition
to God, but also to declare that that law of Divine appointment
which enjoins a man to &ldquo;leave his father and his mother,
and to cleave unto his wife;&rdquo; and forbids &ldquo;man to put
asunder what God hath joined together,&rdquo; is wicked; and, as
he avers, has &ldquo;produced hypocrisy, crime, and misery,
beyond the power of language to express.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that he
would avoid the crime of adultery by making all persons common;
and each man and each woman should be left at perfect liberty to
have whom they liked, keep them as long as they liked, and change
them as often as they liked.&nbsp; Come, this is speaking out;
and it is just what is wanted.&nbsp; The poison then will carry
along with it its own antidote.</p>
<p>On another subject, too, Mr. Owen has spoken plainly.&nbsp; He
says, &ldquo;The love of truth is an instinct of human nature
which would be always exercised in simplicity, were not
individuals praised and blamed for particular feelings,&rdquo; p.
11.&nbsp; The Bible tells us that &ldquo;man goeth astray from
the womb, speaking lies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, which is to be
believed, Robert Owen, or God?</p>
<p>But I ought to beg Robert Owen&rsquo;s pardon; according to
his doctrine, there is no personal God: this is his language:
&ldquo;The error respecting this law of human nature, viz., the
14th, has led man to create a personal Deity, author of all good;
and a personal devil, author of all evil. * * * * And yet, when
the mind can be relieved from the early prejudices which have
been forced into it on these subjects, it will be discovered that
there is not a single fact known to man, after all the experience
of the past generations, to prove that any such personalities
exist, or ever did exist; and, in consequence, all the mythology
of the ancients, and all the religions of the moderns, are mere
fanciful notions of men, whose imaginations have been cultivated
to accord with existing prejudices, and whose judgments have been
systematically destroyed from their birth.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Book of
the New Moral World, p. 46.)&nbsp; And his idea on this awful
subject he explains, when he says, &ldquo;Without a shadow of a
doubt, that truth is nature, and nature God; that &lsquo;God is
truth, and truth is God,&rsquo; as so generally expressed by the
Mohammedans,&rdquo; p. 65; and yet he tells us that &ldquo;man is
a wonderful and curiously contrived being;&rdquo; and that,
&ldquo;in the formation of man and woman there is the most
evident harmony and unison of <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>design,&rdquo; p. 70.&nbsp; How
truth, which is an abstract quality, can be a power, can contrive
and create, is what I do not understand; but, no doubt, Robert
Owen, who, if persons will take his testimony, and follow his
notions, can perform much more wonderful feats than this, will be
able to explain it; especially as he tells us that &ldquo;it is
only now, for the first time, in the known history of mankind,
that the mind has been permitted to examine facts, in order to
discover truth, upon the subjects which have the greatest
influence upon the human race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, before I proceed further, I must here stop to inquire,
Are there any human beings gifted with reason, and in the use of
their sober senses, who can, with their eyes open, rest their
faith upon testimony such as that contained in the Book of the
New Moral World, and stake their eternal interests upon the
reception of that testimony?&nbsp; Then, indeed, are they to be
pitied.&nbsp; They are not only groping in the dark, but they put
out, with their own hands, the only light which can conduct them
through the darkness of this world to the regions of immortal
blessedness and joy.&nbsp; And what do they get in return?&nbsp;
Mr. Owen promises them a paradise&mdash;a paradise, however, only
for this world; his system has nothing to do with anything beyond
the grave; that is a dark and dreary waste, in which, yet, they
must exist and dwell; and, without an acquaintance with, and a
belief in the gospel of Jesus Christ, must live and dwell there
in eternal misery.&nbsp; But, even in the paradise which Mr. Owen
promises, there is not the happiness which his followers
expect.&nbsp; As a proof of this, I beg attention to the
following account of his settlement at New Harmony, in America,
published by Mr. Flint, in his History of the Western
States.&nbsp; Mr. Flint was, and, it is supposed, still is the
friend of Mr. Owen, and was made acquainted by him with his
proceedings; his account, therefore, as far as it goes, may be
considered to be authentic.&nbsp; The statement, too, has now
been five years before the British public; and yet has never, as
far as I am aware, in any shape been contradicted.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Harmony, fifty-four miles below Vincennes,
and something more than a hundred, by water, above the mouth of
the Wabash, is the seat of justice for the county of Posey.&nbsp;
It is situate on the east bank of the river, sixteen miles from
the nearest point of the Ohio, on a wide, rich, and <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>heavily-timbered plateau, or second bottom.&nbsp; It is
high, healthy, has a fertile soil, and is in the vicinity of
small and rich prairies, and is, on the whole, a pleasant and
well-chosen position.&nbsp; It was first settled, in 1814, by a
religious sect of Germans,&rdquo; who resigned it to &ldquo;the
leader of a new sect,&rdquo; who &ldquo;came upon them.&nbsp;
This was no other than Robert Owen of New Lanark, in Scotland, a
professed philosopher of a new school, who advocated new
principles, and took new views of society.&nbsp; He calls his
views upon this subject &lsquo;the Social System.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
was opulent, and disposed to make a grand experiment of his
principles on the prairies of the Wabash.&nbsp; He purchased the
lands and the village of Mr. Rapp,&rdquo; the head and leader of
the Germans, in whose name all the lands and possessions were
held, &ldquo;at an expense, it is said, of 190,000 dollars.&nbsp;
In a short time, there were admitted to the new establishment
from 700 to 800 persons.&nbsp; They danced all together one night
in every week, and had a concert of music on another.&nbsp; The
sabbath was occupied in the delivery and hearing of
lectures.&nbsp; Two of Mr. Owen&rsquo;s sons, from Scotland, and
Mr. M&lsquo;Clure, joined him.&nbsp; The society at New Harmony,
as the place was called, excited a great deal of interest and
remark in every part of the United States.&nbsp; Great numbers of
distinguished men, in all the walks of life, wrote to the
society, making inquiries respecting its prospects and rules, and
expressing a desire, at some future time, to join it.&nbsp; Mr.
Owen&rsquo;s experiment at New Harmony lasted little more than a
year, during which he made a voyage to Europe.&nbsp; The 4th of
July, 1826, he promulgated his famous declaration of
&lsquo;mental independence.&rsquo;&nbsp; The society had begun to
moulder before this time.&nbsp; He has left New Harmony, and the
&lsquo;Social System&rsquo; seems to be abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus far Mr. Flint&rsquo;s account; from which we gather, that
although the establishment was formed under Mr. Owen&rsquo;s
personal superintendence, and managed by himself, and formed,
too, under the most favourable circumstances, yet one short
twelvemonth was sufficient to explode all his views, and to
crumble his system to nothing!&nbsp; But he hopes, perhaps, to
develope it under more favourable circumstances in this country,
and his followers are subscribing monies to enable him so to do;
and yet he tells us that his system is to change the character of
the whole world.&nbsp; It, however, did not seem to meet with a
congenial soil in <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>America, or else he found that it was not suited to that
part of the world.&nbsp; But what failed in America in twelve
months, where he had all his own way, and nothing to interfere
with his plans, is likely to succeed better in England!&nbsp;
What dupes they must be who believe him!</p>
<p>But it did not take even twelve months to show, that in Mr.
Owen&rsquo;s boasted paradise there were the seeds of evil which
he could not eradicate, and miseries which he could not
counteract, as appears from the following testimonies and
statements.&nbsp; The Duke of Saxe Weimar, to whose work a
reference has already been made, states, &ldquo;that it shocked
the feelings of people of education to live on the same footing
with every one indiscriminately, and that several of the
discontented wished to leave the society immediately, and to go
to Mexico.&nbsp; One lady, the widow of an American merchant, was
full of complaints of disappointed expectations.&nbsp; The duke
observed the better educated members of the society keeping
themselves together, and taking no notice of tatterdemalions, who
stretched themselves on the platform.&nbsp; The young ladies of
the better class kept themselves in a corner, forming a little
aristocratical club, and turned up their noses apart at the
democratic dancers, who often fell to their lot, when the
gentlemen, as well as the ladies, drew numbers for the
cotillions, with a view to prevent partialities.&nbsp; The duke
expresses his regret that Mr. Owen should have allowed himself to
be so infatuated by his passion for universal improvement, at the
very time when almost every member of the society with whom the
duke had conversed apart, acknowledged that he was deceived in
his expectations.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Stuart&rsquo;s Three Years in
North America, vol. ii., pp. 444, 445.)</p>
<p>And such, it may be confidently predicted, will be the end of
all Mr. Owen&rsquo;s visions of paradise, if he should ever be
able to do more than draw them on paper, and exhibit them to the
imagination; or present them in his pictures, as is customarily
done, to the enchanted eyes of his followers.&nbsp; But who can
think without sorrow of the evils which result from his
principles? and they do produce innumerable evils!&nbsp; Who can
contemplate so many immortal creatures, fitted for the highest
and the noblest purposes, debasing themselves to a level with the
brutes, and making pleasure and sensual gratification the sole
end of their being; nay, even stooping to be regarded as mere
machines, in order that they may <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>escape from the trammels which they
feel that a sense of accountability throws around them!&nbsp;
Above all, who can behold unmoved the disregard, and even
contempt, with which these persons treat the soul, that immortal
principle, which stamps upon man his dignity, which raises him
above the brutes, and allies him to the inhabitants of the
celestial world, which is the seat of happiness; for the
redemption of whom the Son of God became flesh, and expired on
Calvary, and for whom, when sanctified, there are mansions of
glory provided in heaven?&nbsp; How can men trifle with this
precious jewel, and account it of no value, saying, &ldquo;Let us
eat and drink, for to-morrow we die?&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it not
enough to affect the heart, to draw forth floods of grief, and
make us exclaim, &ldquo;Oh that they knew, even they, in this
their day, the things which belong to their peace!&rdquo; and to
add, &ldquo;Oh that they were wise, that they understood this,
that they would consider their latter end!&rdquo;&nbsp; Happy,
unspeakably happy should I be, if I might be the means of
rescuing and saving any that have been deluded into these errors,
from their perilous situation, and their still greater and more
awful doom, if they continue in them; nor shall I account it a
less privilege to be the humble instrument of preventing any,
that are in danger, from falling into these snares.&nbsp; A
desire to do good, and, if possible, saving good, to my fellow
creatures, is my sole object in taking my pen, and meddling with
the subject.&nbsp; Christianity, like an impregnable fortress,
has often been assailed; men of gigantic minds have directed
their weapons against her, but she has outlived every storm, has
hitherto vanquished even her mightiest foes.&nbsp; I think,
therefore, her friends need be under no alarm on account of the
efforts of Robert Owen to assail or destroy her.</p>
<p>I am, however, departing from my purpose; my object, on the
present occasion, not being to defend Christianity, but simply to
examine Socialism, and to inquire how far the principles of the
New Moral World are calculated to effect the object for which
they are propagated.&nbsp; I think I have shown that in
themselves they want consistency, they are either absurd, or they
lead to absurdity, they destroy the sense of the being of a God,
and, as the necessary consequence, debase the character of man,
making him only a living machine.&nbsp; If the foundation on
which they rest were true, they are not necessary, and their
consequences are most <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>pernicious: and here I think I might
stop, and leave the truth to make its own way; and here I should
stop, were it not that by so doing, I should be acting a very
unjust and unfaithful part towards the cause of Christ.</p>
<p>Then, I do say from conviction, and to use Mr. Owen&rsquo;s
words, &ldquo;a conviction, as strong as conviction can exist in
the human mind;&rdquo; and not only from conviction, but also an
experience, in some humble degree, of the things which I profess
to teach to others, that Christianity, not only promises, but
actually does, for those who believe it, what Socialism promises,
but cannot perform.</p>
<p>Mr. Owen pictures before his followers an earthly
paradise.&nbsp; He promises them, when his establishment shall be
commenced, sights to please the eye, and sounds to enrapture the
ear, more than the imagination can now conceive.&nbsp; He tells
them that, what with the pleasures of the table, the recreations
of music and dancing, and the enjoyments resulting from
philosophical and political discussions, and such like things,
they shall have a happiness unbroken and complete.&nbsp; But even
in his paradise there must be labour, and as each member must
necessarily take his or her proportion of the labour, will he,
for the future, ensure all that enter against such an unpleasant,
and such a mortifying occurrence as took place with the young and
handsome woman, who, when she was singing and playing admirably
on the pianoforte, was told that milking of cows was her
duty!&nbsp; If not, what is the happiness of his paradise
worth?&nbsp; &ldquo;Like the apples of Sodom,&rdquo; beautiful to
the eye, but ashes within.&nbsp; The body may indeed be regaled,
but there is no lasting, no solid joy for the mind.&nbsp; And
this Mr. Owen&rsquo;s followers already have found.&nbsp; I
appeal to themselves for the truth of what I say; and I have the
means of knowing that they will support the truth of my
statement.&nbsp; They have not found perfect happiness yet,
whatever they may do when they get within the walls of his
promised paradise.&nbsp; But if this be the case in health, in
vigour of life, and when surrounded by every thing calculated to
impart pleasure, what, I ask, will be the state of things when
sickness invades the frame, when disease and old age enfeeble and
destroy the body, and when death comes and cuts it down?&nbsp; Is
there, or has he made, any provision against these evils, or will
they change or lose their nature within the walls of this
promised paradise?&nbsp; Ah! if his followers could have <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>assurance of
that, then, indeed, there might be some faint prospect of being
happy&mdash;but he cannot; and they feel he cannot; there is,
therefore, and there must always be, a worm at the root of their
gourd, and poison at the bottom of their cup of pleasure.</p>
<p>And what is there beyond the grave?&nbsp; Yes, I ask, what is
there beyond the grave?&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh that grave!&rdquo; is the
feeling cry of each of their minds: &ldquo;if it were not for the
grave, we should not mind, we should do very well;&rdquo; but
there is the grave; and again I ask, What is there beyond
it?&nbsp; Oh! if any of those that have imbibed these principles
should cast their eye on this page, I beseech them, by the worth
of their souls, by the terrors of the Lord, by the solemnities of
the judgment day, and by the miseries, the eternal miseries of
hell to think of their state, and immediately to flee from the
wrath to come.&nbsp; And let me tell them, for we have no delight
in thundering out these awful realities, on the contrary, we
rejoice to tell them, that if they repent, even for them, there
is salvation, and eternal life through the blood of the
Lamb.&nbsp; Oh then, we beseech them by the mercies of God, we
beseech them by the dying love of Christ, as though God did
beseech them by us, we pray them in Christ&rsquo;s stead,
&ldquo;Be ye reconciled to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what a contrast the Christian presents, to even the best
and the happiest follower of Robert Owen, or even Robert Owen
himself!&nbsp; It is true that he may not be rolling in wealth,
nor surrounded by luxuries; his circumstances may be humble, and
his situation may be poor; but he is happy, unspeakably
happy!&nbsp; He has peace within, a peace which is not
adventitious, which is not the result of circumstances, and will
not change with them; it is &ldquo;peace of conscience,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;peace with God;&rdquo; that &ldquo;peace which passeth
all understanding,&rdquo; and which is full of glory: it is a
peace which &ldquo;the world cannot give, and which the world
cannot take away.&rdquo;&nbsp; It supports the mind in sickness,
it cheers and comforts it in poverty and affliction, it smooths
the pillow of death, it illumines and sheds a glorious radiance
over the dark passage to the grave, and beyond the tomb it is
converted into the fulness of joy, and pleasures for
evermore.&nbsp; Nor am I drawing an imaginary picture; I could
refer to hundreds and thousands who will confirm the
descriptions, as far as their present experience goes; and for
the truth of the statement in <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>reference to death, what multitudes
of death-bed scenes have there been which have compelled even
unbelievers to exclaim, &ldquo;Let me die the death of the
righteous, and let my last end be like his!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Owen&rsquo;s principles have not in a single instance
changed, so as radically to benefit any individual of the human
race; they cannot exalt the moral character.&nbsp; Christianity
has her thousands of trophies of her purity and her power.&nbsp;
They are to be found in every age, and exist in every part of the
world.&nbsp; Mr. Owen&rsquo;s principles never yet made a single
truly happy man: Christianity furnishes them daily.&nbsp; Mr.
Owen&rsquo;s principles are silent about a hereafter, and make no
provision for the world to come: Christianity brings life and
immortality to light by the gospel, takes away the sting of
death, triumphs over the grave, and opens before its followers a
bright and a glorious immortality.&nbsp; Mr. Owen&rsquo;s
principles, independent of their absurdity and atheism, have
nothing to recommend them but his unsupported testimony:
Christianity is confirmed and established by the united testimony
of prophets, and apostles, and evangelists; of martyrs,
confessors, and enemies; of miracles, prophecies, and history; of
its own doctrines, and precepts, and triumphs&mdash;that it is
the word of God!&nbsp; Then we say, If Mr. Owen be what he
pretends, the only teacher that has yet risen to enlighten and to
bless the world, and if his principles, as developed in the
&ldquo;Book of the New Moral World,&rdquo; be the eternal laws of
nature, then follow him: but, if the Lord be God, and
Christianity be Divine, then follow them.</p>

22</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> writing the preceding pages,
I have had an opportunity of both seeing and hearing of the
effects of the system, the principles of which I have endeavoured
to expose: and as the fruits of a tree are not only of great
service in determining the character of the tree which bears
them, but are the best test by which that character may be known,
it may be of use to the cause of truth, and may tend more
effectually than any other means, to explain and expose what
Robert Owen&rsquo;s Socialism is, to state the fruits which it
has already produced.</p>
<p>An intimate friend of mine, resident in a large manufacturing
district, in whose neighbourhood socialists abound, and where
they have had an opportunity, to a very considerable extent, of
developing their system, writes me word: &ldquo;Persons in whose
neighbourhood their meetings are held, speak of their proceedings
as most riotous and disorderly.&nbsp; Young men and young women
assemble in the room, and around it, in great numbers, and the
most demoralizing scenes occur.&nbsp; Twice in the week they meet
for dancing, etc. in the room where their preachings are
held.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as to the persons that compose their societies, it is
notorious that the great bulk of them are young men and women,
who are attracted solely by the pleasures and amusements which
are there held out to them; and the remainder consist either of
persons of bad moral character, or men of unsettled religious
views, as atheists, unbelievers, the followers of Johanna
Southcote, etc.; or, where any have joined them who were once
attached to other bodies, or were professed believers in the
doctrines of revelation, they are, almost without a single
exception, persons whose practices did not accord with their
profession&mdash;&ldquo;men of corrupt minds, reprobate
concerning the faith,&rdquo; 2 Tim. iii. 8.&nbsp; And, although
it is not fair nor honourable to charge either the sentiments, or
the practices of particular individuals upon a whole body, or
even to lay them to the account of the system which they profess;
yet, when those sentiments and practices can be shown fairly to
arise out of the system: and moreover, when they are neither
disavowed nor discountenanced by the body <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>generally,
nor by those persons that may fairly be considered as
representing the body, there can be nothing wrong in adducing
them as illustrations of the nature and the tendency of the
system which produces them.&nbsp; It is solely with this view
that I bring forward the following facts, for the truth of which
I can vouch:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A man named &mdash;, of &mdash;, the clerk
of the socialists at &mdash;, and a clever lecturer, who was once
a missionary, is of so abandoned a character, that nearly at the
time of his marriage with one female, he had an illegitimate
child by another; and he threatened, if a certain person,
&mdash;, of &mdash; opposed his marriage, he would shoot
him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another person, the editor of a periodical which supports the
views of Mr. Owen, and one of the champions of their cause, is
charged publicly by the author of a pamphlet entitled,
&ldquo;Truth without Mystery, mixture of Error, or fear of
Man,&rdquo; with seducing his own wife&rsquo;s sister: nor has
the charge, as far as I can learn, been in any shape denied, or
attempted to be disproved.&nbsp; And not only is he not disowned,
but is still continued as an acknowledged and recognised
supporter and expounder of their principles.</p>
<p>Another man, who was once a preacher, is now a warm advocate
of socialism, and has given a clear illustration of the kind of
morality which may be expected, if the principles of this system
should become at all general; for he has lived already with not
less than eight or ten women in succession.</p>
<p>These facts, which, after all, are only specimens of what
might be adduced, awful as they are, cannot be wondered at; nor
will the reading of them occasion any surprise, when it is known
that the following sentiments are taught and inculcated by the
advocates of these principles:&mdash;A Mr. &mdash; on one
occasion publicly declared, and argued according to one of the
fundamental principles of this system, that men are not to be
held accountable for what they are.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;Each
nation has some particular character of its own.&nbsp; Some
nations think murder right; others are cannibals; and they cannot
help either their belief or their practice. . . .&nbsp; And we
should not punish men for the want of virtue, or the commission
of vice, but we should teach them better.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
socialist lecturer expressed his ideas of God in the following
words:&mdash;&ldquo;He is omnipresent, he is all goodness, he is
all wisdom, he is present in you, he is present in me, he is
present in the murderer, he is present in hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
the conclusion which he wished to draw was, that as God is thus
present everywhere, therefore, he is the author of the crime of
the murderer!!&nbsp; I asked him, &ldquo;Was God all goodness
when he was thus present in the murderer?&rdquo;&nbsp; Or, in
other words, Was murder goodness?</p>
<p>These, and similarly awful sentiments, Mr. Owen&rsquo;s
followers <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>are seeking to extend with the greatest diligence, and
that too, even among the young.&nbsp; Nor have they been
unsuccessful.&nbsp; The effects which already begin to appear are
highly detrimental.&nbsp; In one instance, the son of a professor
of socialism, who goes to school to a Christian, was one morning
too late, and told his master that he could not help being too
late, for he was the creature of circumstances over which he had
no control; when his master very properly replied, then he would
apply a moral motive of sufficient power to induce him to be in
time, and so gave him a good beating.</p>
<p>A sabbath-school teacher, in a neighbourhood where these
principles have extensively spread, bears testimony that,
&ldquo;through the influence of socialism the boys have become so
unmanageable that the teachers do not know what to do: to turn
them out of the school appears to be to doom them to destruction:
and to keep them in is, almost to a certainty, to corrupt the
views and morals of the rest of the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man named &mdash;, of &mdash;, who was once a preacher, but
is now a warm advocate of socialism, has repeatedly confessed
that he has no peace in his own mind.</p>
<p>But, without attempting to adduce more facts as illustrations
of the evils and the tendencies of this system, I may ask, Does
it produce no other fruits besides these?&nbsp; It has now been
tried for some time, and opportunity has been given to develope
and bring to maturity its principles; surely then Robert Owen can
produce, if from no other quarter, at least from his own
establishments, some rare and surpassing specimens of moral
beauty and intrinsic worth, such as the old world and the old
system have in vain attempted to exhibit.&nbsp; Christianity can
exhibit the names of persons whose virtues and excellences have
been the theme of universal admiration, and have extorted from
friends and foes the meed of praise.&nbsp; The list is too long
to transcribe: nor is it necessary; for their memory is embalmed
in the grateful recollections of all who have any perception of
moral goodness, and their deeds shall outlast the course of
time.&nbsp; Can the New Moral World as yet produce no names to
eclipse those of the Christian world?&nbsp; Then, on every
principle, whether of reason, argument, fact, or experience, it
may truly be said as to the social system, &ldquo;Thou art
weighed in the balances, and found wanting.&rdquo;</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
